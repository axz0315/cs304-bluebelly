# CS304BlueBelly
Our CS304 Final Project introducing our web application BlueBelly!

For our final project, we wanted to create an app inspired by Pinterest and Belli! We thought why not design our own platform where users can search for restaurants in the area and also post about their visits (ratings and reviews of the visited restaurant).
