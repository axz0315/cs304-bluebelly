# CS304BlueBelly
For our CS304 final project, we created BlueBelly: a web application featuring a database of crowdsourced restaurant reviews. The app was created for the Wellesley College community, but it can be adapted for a different or larger region. 

With BlueBelly, users can explore restaurants in the area through a dynamic feed of reviews written by fellow users. They can also create their own account and use that to author their own reviews. 

Anatomy of BlueBelly:
- Home page, with a brief welcome message and navbar.
- Log-in page, where users can create an account or log-in to a previously existing one.
- Main feed, which displays submitted reviews including the restaurant name, address, and star rating.
- Review submission form, where users can author and submit reviews.
- Profile page, which displays reviews written by the currently logged-in user and allows users to edit or delete their reviews.
